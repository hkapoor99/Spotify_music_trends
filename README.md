People in different parts of the world prefer to hear songs of different kinds, genres and duration. Spotify is one place where most of them fulfil their music cravings. In this notebook, we will perform a simple EDA of music trends around the globe. Here, we will be using <b>Spotify's Top Songs by Country Charts</b> dataset which was extracted by me using Selenium and BeautifulSoup and is available on Kaggle <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/hkapoor/spotify-top-songs-by-country-may-2020">here</a>. I also gave the charts a Spotify coloured theme.
